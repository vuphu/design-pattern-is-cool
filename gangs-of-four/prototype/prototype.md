## Example 01: Button Copy Properties

Implemented in `samples/prototype.dart`

CopyWith is a pattern quite popular in **Flutter** for managing immutable data. It allows developers to create modified copies of an object with updated properties.

This code showcases the use of the CopyWith method to create modified copies of a Button object. The `Button` class includes properties for `title`, `color`, and `strokeWidth`, and a `copyWith` method that allows you to create a new `Button` instance with some properties modified while keeping others unchanged.
