# memento

## Example 01: Game Checkpoint

Implemented in `samples/game.rs`

This code apply the Memento pattern with the following components:

- **Game**: Manages the game's state.
- **Checkpoint**: Represents a saved state of the game.

The `main` function shows how to create a `Game` instance, modify its state, create a checkpoint, and then restore the game to a previous state using that checkpoint.
