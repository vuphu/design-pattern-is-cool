# bridge

## Example 01: Drawing API

Implemented in `samples/bridge.kt`

This code applies the Bridge pattern, which separates the abstraction from its implementation. It includes the following components:

- **DrawingAPI**: Defines the drawing operations that can be implemented by various drawing APIs.
- **Shape**: Represents a shape that can be drawn using a `DrawingAPI`

The `main` function describe how to create and draw shapes with different `DrawingAPI` implementations.
